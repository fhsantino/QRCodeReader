# QR Code Reader -- Final Course Project
With the evolution of technology and consequently the democratization of internet access through mobile devices, especially on the smartphone segment, the number of mobile tools (applications) developed to meet user needs is growing. According to data for the year 2020, Brazil has seen a 55% growth in app installations in the last two years, significantly above the average of other countries. Associating the potential scenario for the development of mobile solutions together with the need to identify medicinal plants stored in the medicinal plant garden of Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNIP/Sorocaba), used as an object of study for the undergraduate course in Pharmacy, the development of a solution to the problem was planned. The application works by identifying the identification code (QR Code) of the plant, individual for each species, returning to the user the main information of the cataloged species. The Android Studio software development environment (IDE) was used to implement the application with the defined functions, perform tests and make the tool available. As an aid in this process, cloud database management tools were used - Firebase, responsible for storing the data that can be consulted by the application. After implementation and testing by several users, the results indicated ease of use of the application and the features of scanning the QR code of the plant, querying the database and viewing offline data worked as expected, having been used as a test a dataset of 18 medicinal plants.
